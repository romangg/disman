# Disman

Disman is a display management library. Its primary consumer is the display management application
[KDisplay][kdisplay].

## End user
Since this is a development library end users should instead look for support directly for the apps
using this library. Please contact the support channels of your Linux distribution first. In case
the bug is traced back to Disman, you can create an [issue ticket][issue].
